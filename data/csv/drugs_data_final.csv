PNH is a rare acquired, life-threatening disease of the blood that is characterized by the destruction of red blood cells (hemolytic anemia), blood clots (thrombosis), and impaired bone marrow function. Empaveli for PNH works by binding to specific proteins in the complement system, which is a part of the immune system that enhances (or complements) the ability of antibodies and phagocytic cells to clear microbes and damaged cells from an organism, promote inflammation, and attack the pathogen's cell membrane. Empaveli binds to complement protein C3 and prevents it from splitting into C3a and C3b. This helps to stop intravascular hemolysis (IVH or the destruction of red blood cells in the circulation) and extravascular hemolysis (EVH or the breakdown of red blood cells in the spleen, bone marrow, or liver by macrophages). Empaveli is the only treatment that targets C3 and may prevent both forms of red blood cell destruction (IVH and EVH).

It does not require acid to activate it.Voquezna works like a proton pump inhibitor(PPIs) but blocks a different part of the proton pump and is called a potassium-competitive acid blocker (PCAB).,,diarrhea; high blood pressure; indigestion; nausea; stomach bloating; stomach inflammation; stomach pain; urinary tract infection.,vonoprazan,Proton pump inhibitors
