Empaveli for PNH works by binding to specific proteins in the complement system, which is a part of the immune system that enhances (or complements) the ability of antibodies and phagocytic cells to clear microbes and damaged cells from an organism, promote inflammation, and attack the pathogen's cell membrane. Empaveli binds to complement protein C3 and prevents it from splitting into C3a and C3b. This helps to stop intravascular hemolysis (IVH or the destruction of red blood cells in the circulation) and extravascular hemolysis (EVH or the breakdown of red blood cells in the spleen, bone marrow, or liver by macrophages).

Jubbonti works by stopping the formation of osteoclasts before they can reach and damage the bone. It binds to RANKL, a protein on the membrane of osteoclasts essential for their formation, function, and survival. This inhibits osteoclast formation, decreasing bone resorption and increasing bone mass and strength in both cortical (hard bone) and trabecular (spongy bone). Jubbonti is a monoclonal antibody that targets and inhibits RANK ligand (RANKL).","Jubbonti carries a boxed warning for life-threatening severe hypocalcemia (very low calcium levels); the risk is higher in patients with advanced chronic kidney disease (CKD), particularly those on dialysis. The risk increases even more in those with CKD who also have a condition known as mineral and bone disorder (CKD-MBD). Your healthcare provider will evaluate you for hypocalcemia and CKD-MBD before starting treatment and monitor you throughout.
