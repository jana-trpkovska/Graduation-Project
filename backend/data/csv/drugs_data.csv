Drug class: Alpha blockers","Alfuzosin is used to treat the signs and symptoms of benign enlargement of the prostate (benign prostatic hyperplasia or BPH). Benign enlargement of the prostate is a problem that can occur in men as they get older. The prostate gland is located below the bladder. As the prostate gland enlarges, certain muscles in the gland may become tight and get in the way of the tube that drains urine from the bladder. This can cause problems with urinating, such as a need to urinate often, a weak stream when urinating, or a feeling of not being able to empty the bladder completely. Alfuzosin helps relax the muscles in the prostate and the opening of the bladder. This may help increase the flow of urine or decrease the symptoms. However, alfuzosin will not shrink the prostate. The prostate may continue to get larger. This may cause the symptoms to become worse over time. Therefore, even though alfuzosin may lessen the problems caused by enlarged prostate now, surgery may still be needed in the future.","It is very important that your doctor check your progress at regular visitsto make sure that this medicine is working properly and to check for unwanted effects.

Drug class: Selective immunosuppressants","Empaveli (pegcetacoplan) is an immunosuppressant that is given by subcutaneous (under the skin) infusion, which may be used to treat adults with paroxysmal nocturnal hemoglobinuria (PNH). PNH is a rare acquired, life-threatening disease of the blood that is characterized by the destruction of red blood cells (hemolytic anemia), blood clots (thrombosis), and impaired bone marrow function. Empaveli for PNH works by binding to specific proteins in the complement system, which is a part of the immune system that enhances (or complements) the ability of antibodies and phagocytic cells to clear microbes and damaged cells from an organism, promote inflammation, and attack the pathogen's cell membrane. Empaveli binds to complement protein C3 and prevents it from splitting into C3a and C3b. This helps to stop intravascular hemolysis (IVH or the destruction of red blood cells in the circulation) and extravascular hemolysis (EVH or the breakdown of red blood cells in the spleen, bone marrow, or liver by macrophages). Empaveli is the only treatment that targets C3 and may prevent both forms of red blood cell destruction (IVH and EVH).

Fasenra is also approved to treat eosinophilic granulomatosis with polyangiitis (EGPA) in adults. Fasenra's mechanism of action specifically targets eosinophils, which are white blood cells associated with inflammation found in the airways of people with asthma, and the tissues of people with EGPA. Fasenra binds to a protein called interleukin receptor 5Ra (IL-5Ra) on the surface of eosinophils, enhancing the action of natural killer cells from the immune system, which release cytotoxic substances that cause cell death. This MOA of Fasenra depletes eosinophils in tissues and the blood, and reduces inflammation.

Paragard,"
Generic name: copper intrauterine device
Dosage form: intrauterine device
Drug class: Miscellaneous vaginal agents","Paragard is a copper IUD (intrauterine device) used to prevent pregnancy for up to 10 years. Paragard IUD prevents pregnancy by continuously releasing copper, which interferes with sperm transport, fertilization of an egg, and possibly prevention of implantation. When Paragard IUD is inserted it can provide up to 10 years of contraception, and can be removed by a healthcare provider at any time if you decide you want to get pregnant. Paragard IUD is a small, flexible plastic “T” shaped device with copper wrapped around the stem and placed on arms of the “T”. Two thin white threads are attached to the stem (lower end) of the device. The device is inserted into the space inside the uterus, with the threads protruding from the cervix into the vagina. The threads are the only part of Paragard you can feel when it is in your uterus.",,"ectopic pregnancy and intrauterine pregnancy risks:There are risks if you become pregnant while using Paragard (see “What if I become pregnant while using Paragard?”).; life-threatening infection:Life-threatening infection can occur within the first few days after the IUD is placed. Call your healthcare provider immediately if you develop severe pain or fever shortly after it is placed.; pelvic inflammatory disease (PID) or endometritis:Some IUD users get a serious pelvic infection called pelvic inflammatory disease (PID) or endometritis. PID and endometritis are usually sexually transmitted. You have a higher chance of getting PID and endometritis if you or your partner has sex with other partners. PID and endometritis can cause serious problems such as infertility, ectopic pregnancy, and pelvic pain that does not go away. PID and endometritis are usually treated with antibiotics. More serious cases of PID or endometritis may require surgery. A hysterectomy (removal of the uterus) is sometimes needed. In rare cases, infections that start as PID can even cause death.Tell your healthcare provider right away if you have any of these signs of PID or endometritis: low abdominal (stomach area) or pelvic pain, pelvic tenderness, painful sex, unusual or bad smelling vaginal discharge, chills, long-lasting or heavy bleeding, fever, genital lesions or sores.; embedment:Paragard may become attached to (embedded) the wall of the uterus. This may make it hard to remove the device. Surgery may sometimes be needed to remove Paragard.; perforation:Paragard may go through the wall of the uterus. This is called perforation. If this occurs, the IUD may no longer prevent pregnancy. If perforation occurs, the IUD may move outside the uterus and cause internal scarring, infection, damage to other organs, pain, or infertility and you may need surgery to have Paragard removed. Excessive pain or vaginal bleeding during placement of Paragard, pain or bleeding that gets worse after placement, or not being able to feel the threads may happen with perforation. You are not protected from pregnancy if Paragard moves outside the wall of the uterus. The risk of perforation is increased in breastfeeding women.; expulsion:Paragard may partially or completely fall out of the uterus by itself. This is called expulsion. Expulsion occurs in about 2 out of 100 women. Excessive pain, vaginal bleeding during placement of the IUD, pain that gets worse, bleeding after placement, or not being able to feel the threads may happen with expulsion. You are not protected from pregnancy if Paragard is expelled.; changes in menstrual bleeding:You may have heavier and longer periods with spotting in between. Sometimes the bleeding is heavier than usual at first. Call your healthcare provider if the bleeding remains heavier or longer and spotting continues.; reactions after placement or removal:Some women have had reactions such as dizziness (syncope), slowed heart rate (bradycardia), or seizures, immediately after Paragard was placed or removed. This happened especially in women who have had these conditions before.",
